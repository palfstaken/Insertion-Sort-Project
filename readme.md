Patika.dev - Data Structures and Algorithms - Insertion Sort Project

**[22,27,16,2,18,6]** -> Insertion Sort

- Write the stages of the above given sequence according to the sort type.
- Write the Big-O-Notation.
- Time Complexity: Average case: The number we are looking for is in the middle, Worst case: The number we are looking for is at the end, Best case: The number we are looking for is at the beginning of the series.
- What case does the number 18 fall into after the array is sorted? Write down.

## **Answers:**
- 2,22,27,16,18,6
- 2,6,22,27,16,18
- 2,6,16,22,27,18
- 2,6,16,18,22,27

- Big-O-Notation is **O(n²) = O(6²)** 

- The number 18 is included in the average case.
